# RFID MFRC522 driver support for nanoFramework

This drive is a port of the nice work of [bauland/TinyClrLib](https://github.com/bauland/TinyClrLib/tree/master/Modules/Others/MfRc522) 
With added basic ability to write on Mifare1k and MifareUltraLight cards.

For further information about RFID 13.5MHZ cards;
I recommend looking into the awesome job done by [Miguel Balboa's](https://github.com/miguelbalboa/rfid) drive for Arduino repository.


Source Code:[Here](https://github.com/up-streamer/nf_MfRc522)


Note: 
Tests with MifareUltraLight cards are still to be done up to this time.
