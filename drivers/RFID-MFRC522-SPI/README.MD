# RFID MFRC522 driver support for nanoFramework

This drive is a port of [Bauland's](https://github.com/bauland/TinyClrLib/tree/master/Modules/Others/MfRc522) nice work for TinyClrLib.  
Added basic ability to write on Mifare1k and MifareUltraLight cards.

For further information about RFID 13.5MHZ cards;  
I recommend taking a look at [Miguel Balboa's](https://github.com/miguelbalboa/rfid) amazing drive for Arduino.


Source Code: [Here](https://github.com/up-streamer/nf_MfRc522)


Note:  
Tests with MifareUltraLight cards are still to be done up to this time.
