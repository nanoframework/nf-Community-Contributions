## How do I add my contribution?

The goal is to make it simple and with as little ceremony as possible. Nevertheless we have to keep the standard to a minimum! :wink:
If you have a contribution, fork this repo and submit a PR. One of the core team members will give it a quick look and merge it.

### Checklist for submitting a contribution
- [ ] Find a section that best fits your contribution and add it there.
- [ ] Give it good naming. Simple, descriptive and concise.
- [ ] Add a readme.md following the provided template (TBD). 
- [ ] Tidy your code and files inside the contribution folder.
- [ ] Edit the repo [README.md](README.md) to include the mention and link to your contribution. Make sure you put it under the proper section and that the link to it is correct.
- [ ] Make sure it builds.

### I don't want to store my code here

That's fine. 

We understand that you want to keep it on your own repo. If that's the case it's OK to add it as Git sub-module that will link to your repo.

Or could it be that you've simply stumbled on a good piece of code and just want to share that. Then you submit a PR with a simple readme.md linking to that external resouce and a brief explanation about it.
