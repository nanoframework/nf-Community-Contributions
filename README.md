## How do I add my contribution?

The goal is to make it simple and with as little ceremony as possible. Nevertheless we have to keep the standard to a minimum! :wink:
If you have a contribution, fork this repo and submit a PR. One of the core team members will give it a quick look and merge it.

### Checklist for submitting a contribution

- [ ] Find a section that best fits your contribution and add it there.
- [ ] Give it good naming. Simple, descriptive and concise.
- [ ] Add a readme.md following the provided template (TBD). 
- [ ] Tidy your code and files inside the contribution folder.
- [ ] Edit the repo [README.md](README.md) to include the mention and link to your contribution. Make sure you put it under the proper section and that the link to it is correct.
- [ ] Make sure it builds.

### I don't want to store my code here

That's fine and this place is not to store your code! If you want to store your code, please contribute to [nanoFramework.IoT.Device repository](https://github.com/nanoFramework/nanoFramework.IoT.Device).

We understand that you want to keep it on your own repo. If that's the case it's OK to add a link to your repo from a nice README.md.
